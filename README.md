# Community-Detection-in-Reddit-Comment-Networks-with-louvain-and-agglomerative-clustering
This project explores community detection in Reddit comment networks using two distinct algorithms:

**Louvain Algorithm:**
A modularity-based algorithm used for detecting communities in large networks.
The algorithm seeks to maximize the modularity score by identifying densely connected groups of nodes (users) in the Reddit comment network.

**Agglomerative Clustering:**
A hierarchical clustering approach that recursively merges pairs of clusters.
Applied to Reddit comment data to uncover underlying community structures by grouping users based on their interactions.
The project involves preprocessing Reddit data, constructing a graph with users as nodes and their interactions as edges, applying community detection algorithms, and analyzing the characteristics of the detected communities. This can be used to identify specialized sub-communities, assess community engagement, and explore community similarities and differences.
